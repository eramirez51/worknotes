# Performance

* The DAG currently takes 8 hrs to load, where the x-ranking takes 1.5 hours, joining takes 1.5 hrs, and bigtable loading takes 1hr

#  Major Blockers

## Support for legacy devices

Encountered a major blocker while testing the hundred_alts project where we have to support legacy devices
http://starship-visualizer-dev.datascience-team.dev-unext.com/dev/model/hundred_alts/ippan/feature_display/FET0010956/coldstart

To support this, i have to make a major change to the approach

I tried loading the unjoined files to Bigtable, but loading the features data takes a lot of time

As a workaround, i created a hybrid version of the API
* PR of Hybrid Solution in starship-app-autoalt:Â [https://github.com/u-next/starship-app-autoalt/pull/350](https://github.com/u-next/starship-app-autoalt/pull/350)

With this new solution, the Load Test still looks good
