Plan
* Make sure it is configurable via env variables

How to do
* Conditionally do tracing based if env variable (`ENABLE_OTEL_TRACING`?) exist? https://github.com/u-next/datascience-infra-starship/blob/9d00726273f6487fff850e923f457d92b7366856/src/apm/server.js
* Add a `tracing.js` but use `koajs` instead of `hapi`. Use this library "https://www.npmjs.com/package/@opentelemetry/instrumentation-koa"
* Then do [[ðŸŽ¯ Load Test with OTEL]]

# POC
* https://github.com/u-next/datascience-infra-starship/pull/121/files

# What happened

## 2024-03-07
* There was a problem with Cluster's Workload Identity, where the OTEL publisher wont send to PubSub, I was getting 403 Forbidden
 * After creating Workload Identity Pool, it started working, but im not sure if it is actually the solution https://github.com/u-next/datascience-infra-starship/compare/master...feature/workload_identity_pool
* Did a load testing with OTEL enabled. The performance looks good (`tp95 at 25ms`), basically no change from previous performance
