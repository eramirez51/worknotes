Plan
* Add support for OTEL in KoaJs API, make sure it is configurable
* [[ðŸŽ¯Add_OTEL_support_to_API]]
* Support switching-it-off via ENV variable

What happened

## 2024-03-07

* Did a load testing with OTEL enabled. The performance looks good (`tp95 at 25ms`), basically no change from previous performance
