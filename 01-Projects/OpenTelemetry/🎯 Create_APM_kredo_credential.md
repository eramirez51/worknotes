# Background

* The APM client will be calling from on-premise
* We prefer that the client would use [AD FS](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/workload-identity-federation#providers), but need to ask Kou-san, or Bai or Momo about it 

# Plan

To Add Pubsub client to our consumer
* According to this [document](https://cloud.google.com/pubsub/docs/access-control#pubsub.subscriber), we need `roles/pubsub.subscriber` 
* There is no good place to create this kredo credential right now (unique use case), I will add in [[ðŸ•Ž 00 - Kredo]] main repo instead
* I should not add add this in an cred rotator because client will not be able to refresh. Ideally, we should use `AD FS`
