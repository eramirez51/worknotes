[[Project-Book-Autoalt]]
* I am trying to find the reason why the metrics was good last Sprint, but not the next time I ran it.
* The issue was because I was using a wrong config, which generated a bsd2bid mapping for COMIC where it was supposed to generate for BOOK. 
* ![[Pasted image 20230328095011.png]]
* Agreed with using ALS for all media_types
[[System-Dataops]]
* System failed to run  DBT jobs because I was touching [[System-Openstack-Kubes]] yesterday where I deleted the dev2 namespace because it will be replaced by a new one. Unfortunately it caused the Dataops jobs to fail running.
* I should be careful when touching it next time

[[Project-Spotv]]
* Got released today
