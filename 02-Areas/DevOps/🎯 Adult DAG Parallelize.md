# JIRA
https://jira.unext-info.jp/browse/RECO-1591

# System
* [[ðŸŽ¯ Adult DAG]]

# Background
* Currently, Adult recommendation is deployed to SOLR via [[ðŸ•Ž 00 - Streamset]]. But recently, its been failing everyday and needs constant manual attention.
* We suspect that this is due to the increase of number of users, thus it needs a big refactoring to handle the size, one way is via Parallelization
* We tried asking CMS to move this to Starship, but they declined, saying that they prefer to wait for Beemi https://u-next.slack.com/archives/C9V96J8DP/p1710728164928359
# Resources
* DAG code - See [[ðŸŽ¯ Adult DAG]]

# Plan
* Try generating small recos instead of one whole chunk.
