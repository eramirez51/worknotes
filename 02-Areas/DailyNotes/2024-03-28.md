# What happened
*  [[07- RECO-1513 Final adjustments]] 
	* Addtl cache clear and slack - https://github.com/u-next/ds-autoaltmakers/pull/410
* [[ðŸŽ¯  RECO-1590 - ToBQ Partition Filter support]]
	* Investigated the code impact
	* Made some execution plans
	- Investigated how to enable "partition filter required" in the docs. It seems not possible via API.
	- I cannot use the python API, but it seems i can execute a follow up command after like below
```bash	
	bq update --require_partition_filter ${PROJECT}:${DATASET}.${TABLE_NAME}
```
