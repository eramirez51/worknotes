# What happened
* Cleaned up [[ðŸ•Ž 00 - Hundred Alts]] DAG to be more consistent with exiting Autoalt DAGs
* Added the trigger
* Added alarm - https://u-next.slack.com/archives/C014CBBD85B/p1711428195114309
* Additional alert policy, upgrade GCP Terraform lib to support `severity` in alert config https://github.com/u-next/datascience-infra-starship/pull/130
* Investigated `RECO-1587` . 
	* Tried to simulating `not-enough-issue` by assigning a very large CPU resources and tried to call it. But it indeed was not receiving traffic. So probably, the `not-enough-cpu` is happening in the small window after `initcontainer` when the pod will start receiving traffic.
	* Realized we might need to avoid the pod from receiving traffic if it is not guaranteed it is not available yet. We may use Kubernetes `probes` for this.
	* Found there are no `probes` used in our APIs, so we will need to add
	* Found there is a bug in `apibase` where `probes` is also being put to `initContainers` section. made a PR: https://github.com/u-next/starship-app-charts/pull/155
		* I will also need to fix the leadtitle (for now) to start using `probes`. But I will have to add this to all APIs if fix is okay with `leadtitle`
