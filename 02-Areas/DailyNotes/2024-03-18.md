# Incidents
* Autoaltmakers is no longer returning `100 alts`
	* Jens fixed it. https://u-next.slack.com/archives/C06H1U31HA9/p1710718298822899
		* The recent refactoring accidentally dropped the feature

# What happened
* I finished the feature [[ðŸŽ¯ Optimize Bigtable Schema]], but unfortunately, it is not performing well. So I have to revert again. See the [[ðŸŽ¯ Optimize Bigtable Schema]] for more details
